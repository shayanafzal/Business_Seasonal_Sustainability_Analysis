## Three key differences in weather between June and December
1. The above results indicate that the average temperature for June is 75 degrees where as the average for December is 71 degrees. This is a difference of 4 degrees which doesnâ€™t appear too big to cause an impact on ice cream sales.
2. The temperature range in June is between 64 and 85, a rage of 21 degrees. The temperature range in Dec is between 56-83, a rage of 27. This shows that the temperature spread or temperature fluctuation in the month of December is larger. Hence, the day to day December sales may not be as consistent as the day to day June sales.
3. There are a total of 1700 temperature observations recorded for June and a total of 1517 temperature observations recorded for the month of December.
